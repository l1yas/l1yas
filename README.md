# 👋 Hello, I'm Ilyas

**Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Red Team Oriented | Python Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
I am deeply interested in **offensive cybersecurity**, with a strong focus on understanding how tools, protocols, and systems truly work — not just how to use them.

 

## About Me

- Aspiring **Red Team / Pentester**
- I enjoy **problem-solving, puzzles, and technical challenges**
- Strong interest in **Python scripting** for security tooling
- Solid foundations in **network analysis** and **system administration**
- Constantly learning, experimenting, and breaking things (ethically)

 

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, Bash  
- **Cybersecurity**:  
  - Pentesting fundamentals  
  - Enumeration & reconnaissance  
  - Vulnerability analysis  
- **Systems & Networks**:  
  - Linux  
  - Networking basics (TCP/IP, ports, services)  

 

## Current Goals

- Deepen my understanding of **how exploits work internally**
- Improve **code efficiency and performance**
- Prepare for real-world **pentesting & bug bounty** workflows
